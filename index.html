                        <p>After including the script, to initialize nameCrafter, simply call for an instance of nameCrafter. This sets up nameCrafter with it's default Library Options.</p>
                        <h3>Default options include</h3>
                        <p><b>vowels</b>. This piece of regex determines, which characters nameCrafter considers as vowels to detemine cluster sizes. Defaul value is "[aeiouy]" (string).</p>
                        <p><b>consonants</b>. This piece of regex determines, which characters nameCrafter considers as consonants to detemine cluster sizes. Defaul value is "[bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxz]" (string).</p>
                        <p>Do note, you are allowed to set a same character as both vowel and a consonant (like "y" in english, which can be used both as a consonant or vowel sound depending on context). Also technically, nothing prevents you using numbers in your names for example, just do note you need to display them as strings and declare them as either vowels or consonants for code purposes. So yeah, you can generate L33t.</p>

The code checks how many vowels are in the end of lastly randomized syllable, and and if it is higher or the same as the set number, nameCrafter will not attempt to join the cluster with syllables starting with vowels. Otherwise code determines how many vowels would still fit the cluster and only generates the possible syllables that have same amount or fewer vowels on the start of them.</p>

                    <div class="column">
                        <p>Before we can generate any names, we need a syllable library of prefixes, middles and suffixes to choose from! Not only that, the library of a single instance of nameCrafter can actually have multiple prefix, middle and suffix sets for different purposes. All the syllable sets in the single instance of nameCrafter use the same set of library rules that was set in the initialization process, so all the replacements, and bannedClusters apply with all the syllable sets in the library.</p>
                        <p>Typical user case why would you want to use multiple sets in one library would be to have one set for male names, one for female names, and one for family names.</p>
                        <p>To add a single set to the library, you must pass your data through "setToLibrary" function. The function expects at least 4 pieces of information and then optional settings. First, the function wants a string that functions as a <b>name</b> of the particular set. You will call it later to craft names from syllables of this set.</p>
                        <p>Then you set your <b>prefixes</b>, <b>middles</b> and <b>suffixes</b> on that exact order. These can be setup in two possible ways: either a single array with strings, like ["A","B","C","D"], or a single array with multiple smaller arrays with strings in them, like [["A","B"],["C","D"]]. So what is the difference?</p>
                        <p>In a single level array, all syllables in the array are just as likely to occur in the generated code, but in 2 level array, the closer to the start the child array is, more likely the syllables in it are to appear. Basically, syllables in first child array will ne more common, that children of the very last child array. This gives the results a bit more variation and character.</p>
                        <p>Next, one has a chance to add some extra <b>options</b> specific for this set. These are given in an object, which can have these options:</p>
                        <p>The most useful option must be <b>lengthRates</b>. This is an array that defines how many syllables the name generated with this set will have and on which likelyhood. The default value is [1,6,3], which reads as follows: the set will generate names with 1, 2 or 3 syllables. The numbers in the array sum to 10, so likelyhood of a name with 1 syllable to appear is 1/10, 2 syllables 6/10, and 3 syllables 3/10. No name bigger than how many values are set in the array can occur unless otherwise specified, and any position with 0 in it simply means that code will not generate any names with that syllable size. </p>

                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="column">
                        <p><b>preposition</b> & <b>postposition</b>. These are fixed pieces of string that are added to the name after everything else is is done. Imagine you want to generate bunch of names with "Mac" in the front, or maybe phrase "child of ". These could be added through <b>preposition</b> which is tagged in front of the name and otherwise name is generated as normal. <b>postposition</b> works the same, but is added to the end of thet word instead. Neither preposiotions or postpositions count towards the syllable lenght of a name from code perspective, keep that on mind!</p>
                        <p><b>longSyllables</b>. This must be the trickiest of the options. The <b>longSyllables</b> is an object, with 4 keys. These are <b>threshold</b>, <b>maximums</b>, <b>setLengths</b> and <b>forceLengths</b>. Most simple of these is <b>threshold</b> (integer, default value of 0); this sets up what is the defenition on long syllable in this context. Any number (larger than 1) set as threshold is considered to be how many characters must be present in a syllable to make it considered "long". Nothing else here will work, unless the threshold is set!</p>
                        <p>Next is <b>maximum</b>, (default value of null, wants an array). In maximum, you can set up an array of integers. Each cell defines how many long syllables are allowed in the single name. For example, name with 3 syllables that are atleast 4 characters long gets wieldy quite fast, but if you have written integer 1 in the third cell in the maximum array and have a 3 in the threshold, the code makes sure, that you can only have a single syllable in the word that has 3 or more characters. Code randomizes on each syllable, and checks the syllable size, and ones the maximum size syllable-slots have ran out, there won't be anymore long syllables in the word.</p>

This one is is trickier to set up as you are required to setup an array filled with arrays, populated by booleans - sounds a lot, but let's break that down. Like with maximums, each cell of the parent array matches with corresponding syllable size; first is for 1 syllable word, 2nd for 2 syllable word etc. Each of them can be presented with a child array to first one, where each cell presents a single syllable. You can set these either true or false, representing which represents, is the code allowed to use long syllables in that particular syllable spot. This will override any maximums set in particular syllable size given, but remember that the code might still transfer a possibility of long syllable forward.</p>
                        <p>If you truly want to fix the lenghts down, use <b>forceLengths</b> (boolean, default false). If a threshold is set, but there is no <b>maximums</b> or <b>setLengths</b> set, code will force all the syllables to be short. If <b>maximums</b> are set but no <b>setLengths</b>, code will burn all the possible long syllables at the begining syllable(s) of the name, and rest are going to be forced short. And if you got <b>setLengths</b> set, long and short syllables will go exactly where you have set them and nowhere else.</p>

                        <p>And so, we can start actually crafting names. After all the setups, at this point things get considerably easier. All you need to do is call <b>craftName("name_of_your_set")</b>, and you already got in return an object with string <b>name</b> that is compiled from the syllables that the code chose, and an array by the name <b>originalSyllables</b> that includes the syllables tha name was made from plus the possible pre- or postpositions.</p>
                        <p>Do note, that if any change where made to the name by the "replaceables", this only shows up in the "name"-string, not in the "originalSyllables"-array. This could be used to spot problems with "replaceables", but also could be used to display the construction, like is the syllables/parts have a meaning in your fantasy language and things of that sort.</p>
                        <p>However, I do not know in what context you need to call the craftName function, maybe there is a situation you want to keep the set-options intact but need a make a specific exception to one of the rules to... lets say, create this instance of of a name that is exactly 2 syllables/parts long, instead of raffling the syllable count, or maybe for a certain instance, you want to change the odds which certains lenght of names appear?

                        <p>So, maybe you want more options right away, or you want to build a fullname, with first name, middle name, and a last name. Well, that is what <b>craftMultipleNames()</b> is for! </p>
                        <p>In it's most simplest form, you enter an integer (1 or higher) and a name (string) of a set to the craftMultipleNames-function, and it will generate you an array with as many name objects as the integer defined. However, you can also enter it and array, that includes a list of names of sets you want to appear in single full name. Array can be filled with strings, or instead you can use objects with key "set" indicating the name of the set yopu wish to use. in and object, you can also include <b>exceptions</b> object, working similarly as presented with the <b>craftName</b>-function.</p>

                        <p>Safety first, as they say. To make sure you don't crash your computer by trying to generate huge list of names, the <b>nameCrafter</b> has inbuild <b>safetySettings</b> to stop the numbers going all silly.</p>
                        <p>You can chage the limits though with the handy dandy <b>changeSafetySettings</b>-function. If you give a value, larger than the numbers, the code will automatically cap the loops to the set maximum value in safetySettings. Enter the value you wished to change with the key corresponding the thing you wish to edit. Default values go as follows:</p>
                        <p><b>maxFullNames</b>. (Default value 30) This tells the maximum size of the integer you can enter to <b>craftMultipleNames</b>-function.</p>
                        <p><b>maxSingleNames</b>. (Default value 10) When entering the full name structure in an set-array to the <b>craftMultipleNames</b>-function. If array includes more values than set integer, only the first array cells preceiding the number will be generated.</p>
                        <p><b>maxSyllables</b>. (Default value 10) Maximum amount of syllables/parts that code will join together.</p>
