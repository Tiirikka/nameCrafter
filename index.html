                        After including the script, to initialize nameCrafter, simply call for an instance of nameCrafter. This sets up nameCrafter with it's default Library Options.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Default options include</h3>
                    <p>
                        <b>vowels</b>. This piece of regex determines, which characters nameCrafter considers as vowels to detemine cluster sizes. Defaul value is "[aeiouy]" (string).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>consonants</b>. This piece of regex determines, which characters nameCrafter considers as consonants to detemine cluster sizes. Defaul value is "[bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxz]" (string).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Do note, you are allowed to set a same character as both vowel and a consonant (like "y" in english, which can be used both as a consonant or vowel sound depending on context). Also technically, nothing prevents you using numbers in your names for example, just do note you need to display them as strings and declare them as either vowels or consonants for code purposes. So yeah, you can generate L33t.
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <p>
                        <b>maxVowels</b>. This number tells the nameCrafter, how many vowels it is allowed to cluster together, default value is 2 (integer). The code checks how many vowels are in the end of lastly randomized syllable, and and if it is higher or the same as the set number, nameCrafter will not attempt to join the cluster with syllables starting with vowels. Otherwise code determines how many vowels would still fit the cluster and only generates the possible syllables that have same amount or fewer vowels on the start of them.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>maxConsonants</b>. Works identically to maxVowels, only with consonants. The default value set is 3 (integer).

                    <p>Again, disclaimer: inside you syllables you can use as big of vowel or consonant clusters you like, code doesn't police the syllables themselves, only on which syllables can follow that syllable.</p>

                        <b>bannedClusters</b>. As the nameCrafter build a name, starting from a prefix and continuing on to middle and suffix syllables, code will check them for consonant and vowel clusters... but also for anything you put in to the banned cluster object. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All entries to bannedCluster-object go in "key" : "value" - form, were key is a string that code will check against the already chosen parts of a name with regex match and value is one that the code checks the potential next syllables for. If both key matches with the already exsisting part of the name and value with the potential new syllable, code will <u>NOT</u> use that syllable to continue the name. This is important. the bannedClusters takes AWAY options, it doesn't add them.

                        <b>replaceables</b>. Just like bannedClusters, replaceables is an object, where "key" is compared to the existing name - but not before the name is already finished. No, replaceables is one of the very last things applied to the name, and it's value is actually another object where key presents character or character cluster one wishes to replace, and value shows what that cluster changes in to. Just like bannedClusters, this object is empty by default.

                        Use both of these options sparingly and responsibly.

                    <p>
                        Last, but not least, we got regex modifiers, <b>matchModifier</b> (default value "gi") and <b>replaceModifier</b> (default value "g"). These modifiers are used in all instances of match and replace functions respectively.

                    <p>
                        Before we can generate any names, we need a syllable library of prefixes, middles and suffixes to choose from! Not only that, the library of a single instance of nameCrafter can actually have multiple prefix, middle and suffix sets for different purposes. All the syllable sets in the single instance of nameCrafter use the same set of library rules that was set in the initialization process, so all the replacements, and bannedClusters apply with all the syllable sets in the library.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Typical user case why would you want to use multiple sets in one library would be to have one set for male names, one for female names, and one for family names. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To add a single set to the library, you must pass your data through "setToLibrary" function. The function expects at least 4 pieces of information and then optional settings. First, the function wants a string that functions as a <b>name</b> of the particular set. You will call it later to craft names from syllables of this set.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then you set your <b>prefixes</b>, <b>middles</b> and <b>suffixes</b> on that exact order. These can be setup in two possible ways: either a single array with strings, like ["A","B","C","D"], or a single array with multiple smaller arrays with strings in them, like [["A","B"],["C","D"]]. So what is the difference?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a single level array, all syllables in the array are just as likely to occur in the generated code, but in 2 level array, the closer to the start the child array is, more likely the syllables in it are to appear. Basically, syllables in first child array will ne more common, that children of the very last child array. This gives the results a bit more variation and character.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Next, one has a chance to add some extra <b>options</b> specific for this set. These are given in an object, which can have these options: 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>preposition</b> & <b>postposition</b>. These are fixed pieces of string that are added to the name after everything else is is done. Imagine you want to generate bunch of names with "Mac" in the front, or maybe phrase "child of ". These could be added through <b>preposition</b> which is tagged in front of the name and iotherwise name is generated as normal. <b>postposition</b> works the same, but is added to the end of thet word instead.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The more used option however must be <b>lengthRates</b>. This is an array that defines how many syllables the name generated with this set will have and on which likelyhood. The default value is [1,6,3], which reads as follows: the set will generate names with 1, 2 or 3 syllables. The numbers in the array sum to 10, so likelyhood of a name with 1 syllable to appear is 1/10, 2 syllables 6/10, and 3 syllables 3/10. No name bigger than how many values are set in the array can occur unless otherwise specified, and any position with 0 in it simply means that code will not generate any names with that syllable size. 
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <h2>craftName function</h2>
            <div class="row">

                    <p>
                        And so, we can start actually crafting names. After all the setups, at this point things get considerably easier. All you need to do is call <b>craftName("name_of_your_set")</b>, and you already got in return an object with string <b>name</b> that is compiled from the syllables that the code chose, and an array by the name <b>originalSyllables</b> that includes the syllables tha name was made from plus the possible pre- or postpositions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Do note, that if any change where made to the name by the "replaceables", this only shows up in the "name"-string, not in the "originalSyllables"-array. This could be used to spot problems with "replaceables", but also could be used to display the construction, like is the syllables/parts have a meaning in your fantasy language and things of that sort. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, I do not know in what context you need to call the craftName function, maybe there is a situation you want to keep the set-options intact but need a make a specific exception to one of the rules to... lets say, create this instance of of a name that is exactly 2 syllables/parts long, instead of raffling the syllable count, or maybe for a certain instance, you want to change the odds which certains lenght of names appear? Well, you are in luck as craftNames accepts <b>exceptions</b>-object, where you can do just that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently, you can change 3 different things with "exceptions" object. You can override pre- and/or postposition, or you can set <b>nameLength</b>. The nameLenght can be an integer (min value of 1) that fixes the syllable/part amount of the name generated, or you can give it and array and set propabilities like with <b>lengthRates</b> when setting up a set in a first place.
